    <h1>📜 XPF TrueStart Extension Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy explains how the <strong>XPF TrueStart</strong> Chrome/Edge New Tab extension collects, uses, and protects user data. The primary purpose of this extension is to customize your browser's New Tab page and provide a retro Windows XP-style interface.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collected and Stored</h2>

    <p>The <strong>XPF TrueStart</strong> extension stores data <strong>exclusively on the user's local device</strong> to customize and enhance the user experience. This data is maintained using the browser's local storage (<code>localStorage</code>) and is <strong>never transmitted to the extension developer or any third-party server.</strong></p>

    <p>The data collected and stored locally includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Favorite Site Records:</strong> Names and URLs of websites added by the user.</li>
        <li><strong>Sticky Note Content:</strong> Text written by the user in the note widget.</li>
        <li><strong>Widget Positions and States:</strong> The last position of the Sticky Note (e.g., <code>translate3d</code> values) and its visibility status.</li>
        <li><strong>Music Favorites:</strong> Unique <strong>YouTube Video IDs</strong> belonging to music tracks liked by the user (<code>myMusicFavs</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>Interface Settings:</strong> The number of rows set for the Favorites grid (<code>favGridRows</code>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Use of Data</h2>

    <p>The locally stored data is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To ensure that the extension settings and user-customized content (Favorites, Notes) are loaded when the New Tab is opened.</li>
        <li>To create and play the list of music tracks liked by the user in the music player.</li>
        <li>To ensure the note widget opens in the location where the user last left it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

    <p><strong>XPF TrueStart</strong> <strong>does not transmit, share, or sell any user information</strong>, including the locally stored data, to any developer-owned server or third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>The extension utilizes an embedded YouTube player within an iframe for its music playback functionality. When using this service, <strong>YouTube's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</strong> apply. The developer is not responsible for any data collected by YouTube.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>YouTube Embedded Player:</strong> When a user initiates music playback, their browser establishes a connection with YouTube. YouTube may collect anonymous viewing data through this embedded player.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. User Control</h2>

    <p>You have full control over all local data within the extension:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Favorite links and Note content can be edited or deleted directly through the extension interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Clearing Data:</strong> By deleting the storage area associated with this extension via your browser's settings, all your local data (Favorites, Notes, Music Favorites) will be permanently erased.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Significant changes to the policy will be announced on the Chrome Web Store page before a new version of the extension is published.</p>
